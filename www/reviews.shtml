	   <blockquote>
		   <p>Many governments around the world view traffic jams as a serious problem. Vehicles in traffic jams emit higher concentrations of pollutants, and the people in those vehicles waste valuable time. For those reasons traffic-flow research should be advanced. The knowledge gained could help increase flow and reduce jams, which would lead to improved efficiencies and a cleaner environment. But is such research physics? I think that after reading Martin Treiber and Arne Kesting’s Traffic Flow Dynamics: Data, Models and Simulation, you will agree that it is. [...] </p>

           <p>[...] It’s a pity that there’s currently a big gap between traffic-flow science and traffic engineering, but this book admirably connects the physical mechanisms leading to a traffic jam with such engineered solutions as adaptive cruise control and ramp metering. [...]</p>

		   <p>[...] I expect that <em>Traffic Flow Dynamics</em> will bridge the different fields involved - physics, mathematics, computer science, traffic engineering, and others. I also think it will be a useful guide for students who want to make the jump into a fascinating area of research.</p>
